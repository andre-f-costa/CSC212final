## Hilbert curves
### Note
On when calling hilbert, call with output file name, size and number of iterations. Hilbert has a maximum output size of 10,000x10,000.
>Example: "./hilbert testoutput.ppm 1000 3"
>
The above call will create a file called testoutput.ppm, of size 1000x1000 with 3 iterations of the hilbert curve.
